# Composites

made for the MAE 472 Composites course

## Things that this will hopefully do

* nicely compute ABD matrices for laminates
* have a tkinter GUI for material inputs
* have a tkinter GUI for laminate stacking sequences
* not be dependent on the GUI for making these structures (e.g. also read from JSON or csv)
* using mixing formulas if necessary
